    GIT is developed using C/C++ it is command based!!
    Git is used for tracking the repository folder.
for Git Codes -> https://gitcheatsheet.org

-> All changes are stored in hidden(command+shift+.) git folder in the project folder.

* git status <- Shows valuable information, like which files are Untracked, Unmodified, Modified, Staged or Unstaged in the current branch, the current branch name, or whether the current branch is up-to-date, ahead or behind the remote branch.

* git init <- Create a new local repository

* git config --global user.email pratapsushil@gmail.com

* git config --global user.name “Sushil Pratap”
    
U -> Untracked **
.DS_Store is a system file -> no need to track
 
* git add .   <- staging ....[1]
        -> * git status
A -> Added for tracking **     
added to staging <- getting ready to commit

* git commit -m "created new file"  ......[2]
 git commit <- pls note down the changes.
 when give commit give a message -> git commit - m "----message----"
 
* git save -> pls store this   ........[3]

* git log -> Displays the history 
* git log --oneline -> Displays in one line
M -> Modified **

** Every React Project is a Repository by default!!

** Git Branches: 
    Last commit is referred as Branch -> if u have 10 commits 10th commit is called a Branch
    -> we can a give a name to the branch, default name will be Master
* git branch -m {give any name}   
     git branch -m main 

     To create a seperate copy of the branch. 
* git branch my-new-branch -> a branch has been added to the last commit.

* git branch -a <- Lists both local and remote branches, * represents current branch.

* git checkout -b my-new-branch <- Create a branch and checkout (switch) to it
Creates and checks out (switch) to a new branch named "my-new-branch".

Stash & Reset -> Both are useful for Deleting.

2. Reset -> Is used to Delete Commited changes. -> Ex: Some issues after few commits & would like to go back.
   based on the ID we can Reset. WARNING - its a permanant delete.
